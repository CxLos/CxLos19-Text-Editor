# CxLos19 Text Editor

## Description
```
The motivation in developing this project was to create a text editing app that can be used on or offline. I built this so that I can write down some handy notes and view them later. This app is meant to solve the issue of keeping track of notes wherever you are regardless of internet connection. In constructing this app, I learned a lot, primarily with service workers and manifest.json. I learned how they work together in progressive web apps to make an application more technologically up to date and perfom at higher quality.
